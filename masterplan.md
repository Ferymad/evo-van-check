Project Overview
Create a web-based van inspection checklist application that allows drivers to submit vehicle inspection forms digitally. The application should store inspection data securely and send weekly summary notifications.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React with Vite
Backend: FastAPI (Python)
Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
Authentication: Supabase Auth
Notifications: SendGrid
Hosting: Vercel (frontend), Railway/Render (backend)
Detailed Development Roadmap
1. Project Setup
Initialize React project with Vite
npm create vite@latest van-inspection-app -- --template react
cd van-inspection-app
npm install

Set up FastAPI backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy supabase sendgrid

Configure Supabase project
Sign up for Supabase and create a new project.
Set up database tables and authentication.
2. Database Design
Create Supabase table structure for van inspections
CREATE TABLE van_inspections (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  plate_number TEXT NOT NULL,
  driver_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  mileage INTEGER,
  engine_start BOOLEAN,
  engine_noise BOOLEAN,
  transmission_smooth BOOLEAN,
  brakes_effective BOOLEAN,
  brake_noise BOOLEAN,
  steering_normal BOOLEAN,
  steering_noise BOOLEAN,
  tires_inflated BOOLEAN,
  tire_wear BOOLEAN,
  wheel_nuts_secure BOOLEAN,
  lights_working BOOLEAN,
  interior_components BOOLEAN,
  battery_charged BOOLEAN,
  oil_level BOOLEAN,
  ride_smooth BOOLEAN,
  body_damage BOOLEAN,
  additional_comments TEXT,
  inspection_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);

3. Frontend Development
Install necessary dependencies
npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer react-hook-form axios @supabase/supabase-js react-router-dom framer-motion

Set up Tailwind CSS
Configure Tailwind CSS according to the installation guide.
Create form components
Use React Hook Form for handling form submissions and validations.
Design a responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
4. Backend API Development
Create FastAPI routes
Implement endpoints for form submissions and data retrieval.
Connect to Supabase
Use Supabase Python SDK to handle database operations.
Implement data validation
Use Pydantic models for request validation.
5. Authentication
Implement Supabase authentication
Secure API routes using JWT tokens.
Use Supabase Auth for user signup and login.
6. Notification System
Set up SendGrid for email notifications
Configure SendGrid API credentials.
Implement Celery for task scheduling
Set up Celery with Redis to handle weekly notification tasks.
Generate and send weekly inspection summaries
Query inspection data from Supabase.
Generate summary reports and send via SendGrid.
7. Testing
Write unit tests for frontend components
Use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
Implement integration tests for API endpoints
Use tools like pytest and requests for testing backend functionality.
8. Deployment
Deploy frontend to Vercel
Set up a Vercel account and deploy the frontend application.
Deploy backend to Railway or Render
Configure the backend service with the respective platform.
Set environment variables
Ensure all necessary environment variables are configured in both frontend and backend environments.
9. Monitoring & Optimization
Set up error tracking with Sentry
Integrate Sentry for both frontend and backend to monitor and track errors.
Implement performance monitoring
Use tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring application performance.
Future Enhancements
AI-powered issue detection
Use machine learning to analyze inspection notes and predict maintenance needs.
Mobile responsiveness
Ensure the application is fully functional on mobile devices.
Advanced reporting features
Implement more detailed and customizable reports.
Fleet management extensions
Add features for tracking vehicle histories, scheduling maintenance, etc.
Development Commands
Frontend development server
npm run dev

Backend development server
uvicorn main:app --reload

Run tests
npm test
pytest

By following this roadmap, you can build a scalable, efficient, and user-friendly van inspection checklist application. This setup ensures that your application is well-structured, secure, and easy to maintain, providing a solid foundation for future enhancements and growth.
